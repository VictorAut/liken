- Help newcomers with getting started
- Teach readers about your library by making them
    write code
- Inspire confidence through examples that work for
    everyone, repeatably
- Give readers an immediate sense of achievement
- Show concrete examples, no abstractions
- Provide the minimum necessary explanation
- Avoid any distractions

When you use `enlace.Dedupe`, you can also make use of the advanced Rules API.

This API is exposed via [enlace.rules][] and additionally provides a number of
*discrete* (binary) dedupers, such as `enlace.rules.isna`, which are primarily intended
for use in rule-based matching.
